/**
 * This class extends StartSetCommandTest. It is for running in UNIX. The parent class has some tests that fail on UNIX 
 * (or intermittently fail on UNIX) but pass in windows. This class excludes those tests by overriding them and giving them 
 * an Ignore tag. This class should be run on a UNIX machine instead of its parent class. All the tests seen in parent calls
 * will be run, and the ones marked in this class with Ignore tag will not be run. 
 * NB: When a way is found for an ignored test in this class to always pass on UNIX, then it should be updated here and have 
 * its Ignore tag removed.
