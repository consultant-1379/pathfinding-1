/**
 * This class extends StartAndWaitSetCommandTest. It is for running in UNIX / CI Server. The parent class has some tests that fail on UNIX / CI Server 
 * (or intermittently fail) but pass in windows. This class excludes those tests by overriding them and giving them 
 * an Ignore tag. This class should be run on UNIX machine / CI Server instead of its parent class. All the tests seen in parent
 * will be run, and the ones marked in this class with Ignore tag will not be run. 
 * NB: When a way is found for an ignored test in this class to always pass on UNIX / CI Server, then it should no longer be ignored here.
